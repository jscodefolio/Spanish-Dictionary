# Spanish-Dictionary
This project was created as a way to help me access verb forms and their conjugations easier for a Spanish class. I finished the class before I finished the program.
This program is an empty dictionary that is meant for entries to be added to.
When a new term is added, the program creates a folder of the same name at the root directory and 3 text files inside for the different types of conjugations.
Those files are then meant to be edited by the user to list the different conjugations of that type in a particular order.

The program then is able to access the folders and files it creates to display a summary view of the dictionary entry.
