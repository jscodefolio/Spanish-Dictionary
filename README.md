# Spanish-Dictionary
This program is an empty dictionary that is meant for entries to be added to.
When a new term is added, the program creates a folder of the same name at the root directory and 3 text files inside for the different types of conjugations (Indicative, Subjunctive, Imperative)
Those files are then meant to be edited by the user to list the different conjugations of that type in a particular order.

The program then is able to access the folders and files it creates to display a summary view of the dictionary entry.
